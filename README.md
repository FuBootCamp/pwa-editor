## Description of the project

The challenge 19 consists of converting a basic application (a text editor) into a progressive web application, for which the necessary libraries had to be incorporated so that this application complies with the characteristics of a progressive application, that can be installed on the device to function as a native application, that can work offline and that has good performance and good speed.

Understanding how the different libraries or utilities that will allow us to convert the text editor into a progressive web application work was very motivating, utilities such as webpack to integrate into a single package where all parts of the code are integrated, the work box application to incorporate the services workers to work as caches and allow the application to have a better performance, and incorporate the manifest file that is also part of the webpack.

Understanding how all these libraries are designed to make it easier and easier for applications to perform better is very interesting, and I believe that as I release applications, incorporating these capabilities will make applications better products.Incorporating the text editor application so that it can operate off-line saving the user's information in local storage or in this case in the indexDB, incorporating parts of the code to a caching scheme so that the application does not have to reload all the information every time a change occurs and packaging all the code in fully optimized bundles, will definitely allow to have applications with better performance.

In this challenge I finished understanding how it works and how valuable is the package.json file, with the scripts that allow to run in different ways the applications, and in this case where we had a client-server structure and through the same script run both applications concurrently.

During the development of this application at the time of testing I was using browser pages in incognito mode, but unfortunately they did not allow me to test 100% the facility for the application to install, so I had to use the normal browser to test that the installation facility and the install button was working properly. It is good to understand how these incognito pages work and why in this case it was not the best to use it.

Finally, I consider that this challenge incorporates very good tools for the process of polishing our applications and making them more attractive to the end user.
